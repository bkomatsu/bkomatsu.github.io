I am a researcher at the [Ruth Cardoso Chair at Insper](https://www.insper.edu.br/pesquisa-e-conhecimento/centro-de-gestao-e-politicas-publicas/catedra-ruth-cardoso/) and a Lecturer at [Insper](https://www.insper.edu.br/en/). The Ruth Cardoso Chair makes research on public policy, focusing on oportunity inequalities, early childhood and education. I also collaborate with the [Brazilian Center for the Early Child Development](https://cpapi.org.br/en), a research center that aims to promote advances in the understanding of Early Childhood Development in Brazil, by offering scientific evidence to support: (i) the measurement and monitoring of ECD; and (ii) the review and design of public policies aimed at reducing inequalities and promoting the development of all children

My research interests are public policy and impact evaluation. I am currently focusing on public policy and risk factors for early childhood development.
